# 🌿 Nature Image Color Channel Visualizer

## Highlights
- Visualizes individual RGB channels  
- Converts images to grayscale  
- Applies selectable colormaps  
- Interactive UI with Streamlit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Streamlit-based image processing application**
that visualizes RGB color channels and applies different colormaps to grayscale
images. The application helps in understanding how images are represented as
pixel arrays and how color information is processed.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To understand image representation using NumPy arrays
- To visualize individual RGB color channels
- To apply different colormaps on grayscale images
- To build an interactive visualization tool using Streamlit

---

## 🧠 Features
- Load a nature image dynamically from a URL
- Separate and visualize **Red**, **Green**, and **Blue** color channels
- Convert the image to **grayscale**
- Apply multiple **Matplotlib colormaps** interactively
- User-friendly and responsive **Streamlit UI**

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – array and pixel manipulation
- **Pillow (PIL)** – image loading and processing
- **Matplotlib** – colormap visualization
- **Requests** – image download from URL
- **Streamlit** – interactive web application

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. Load image from an external URL
2. Convert image into NumPy array
3. Extract RGB channels
4. Visualize each color channel separately
5. Convert image to grayscale
6. Apply selected colormap dynamically using Streamlit

🎤 Interview Explanation
“This project demonstrates basic image processing concepts such as RGB
channel separation and grayscale visualization. I used NumPy for pixel
manipulation and built an interactive Streamlit application to visualize
different colormaps dynamically.”
